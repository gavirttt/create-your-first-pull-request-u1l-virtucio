I'm expecting a challenging but fun experience in this course. I also believe this would be super beneficial as I pursue the software developer profession!

I agree that CMSC 100 will be super beneficial as web development is one of the most prominent fields in computer science. I also agree that it will be fun but at the same time challenging.
